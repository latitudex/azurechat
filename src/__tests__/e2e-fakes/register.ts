// Use the same RELATIVE path that production source files (cosmos.ts,
// openai.ts) use. Turbopack production builds can otherwise treat
// `@/features/...` aliased and `./...` relative imports as TWO different
// modules, producing two parallel `service-container` instances with two
// independent registries. The fake registration ends up in one registry,
// the production resolve() reads from the other, and the production
// factory wins.
