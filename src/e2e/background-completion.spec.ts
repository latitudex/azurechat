/**
 * Real-user invariant: I send a message on thread A, immediately navigate
 * away to /chat (the empty home), wait a moment for the server to finish
 * the LLM call in the background and persist to Cosmos, then navigate back
 * to thread A. The assistant reply must be visible WITHOUT a manual reload.
 *
 * Why this matters:
 *   - The route persists from streamText.onFinish so the server completes
 *     even if the client disconnects.
 *   - The route is force-dynamic and the Next.js router cache for dynamic
 *     routes is disabled (staleTimes.dynamic = 0), so returning to /chat/[id]
 *     refetches fresh data instead of serving a stale RSC snapshot.
 *   - The chat-page passes the freshly-server-rendered messages into
 *     ChatStoreProvider, which calls chat.setMessages so useChat's in-memory
 *     state picks them up without a full page refresh.
 *
 * If any of those is broken, the "Generating in background…" pill stays
 * forever and this test fails.
 *
 * Runs against AZURECHAT_TEST_BACKEND=memory — the fake provider replies
 * with the well-known TEST_REPLY string fast enough that persistence is
 * done before we navigate back.
